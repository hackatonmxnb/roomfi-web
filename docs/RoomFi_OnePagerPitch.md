# STRATEGIC PROJECT MEMORANDUM

**DATE:** January 14, 2026
**TO:** Mantle Global Hackathon Judging Committee
**FROM:** RoomFi Protocol Founding Team
**SUBJECT:** Strategic Thesis: Hybrid Decentralization of the Latin American Rental Market

---

## I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

RoomFi Protocol ("The Protocol") presents a unique value proposition for the Mantle ecosystem by addressing the technological restructuring of the residential rental market. Built on the **Mantle Network**, RoomFi creates a rigorous hybrid infrastructure that bridges the $2.8 Trillion real estate market with the liquidity and transparency of Decentralized Finance (DeFi).

**Objective:** This memorandum serves to present the project's strategic roadmap and economic thesis to the **Mantle Global Hackathon Committee**, demonstrating the path to capture of the CDMX market through strategic pilots and an eventual $150,000 USD Pre-Seed structure.

## II. MARKET ANALYSIS & PROBLEM STATEMENT

The Protocol identifies a structural inefficiency in the Latin American housing market, characterized by a dual-sided friction that results in significant capital stagnation.

### A. The Micro-Economic Friction (User Persona)
The current market fails the mobile professional. Our analysis centers on "Maria," a representative profile of a student or professional relocating to a hub like Mexico City (CDMX). She faces:
1.  **Credit Invisibility:** Lack of cross-border credit history prevents risk assessment.
2.  **Capital Lock-up:** Requirement of up to 3 months of security deposit.
3.  **Sunk Costs:** Legal fees (~$800 USD) and lack of formal payment proofs.

### B. The Macro-Economic Liquidity Trap
Systemically, the region suffers from "Dead Capital"—a term coined by economist Hernando de Soto. Internal analysis, cross-referenced with Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) housing deficit data, identifies over **$50 Billion USD** stagnating in rental security deposits across LATAM. Currently, these funds generate **0% yield** and are trapped in non-portable reputation silos.

## III. PROPOSED SOLUTION & ARCHITECTURE

RoomFi operates as a non-custodial technological layer that transforms static lease agreements into dynamic, liquid financial assets.

### A. Technological Pillars
*   **Hybrid Ricardian Contracts:** A legal-technological framework where the on-chain smart contract is cryptographically bound to a valid Civil Code lease. This serves as the bridge between EVM execution and court enforceability (anchored on **NOM-151** standards).
*   **Tenant Passport (Soulbound NFT):** A Zero-Knowledge Identity layer that aggregates reputational data. This creates a portable "Credit Score for Rent" that follows the user, eliminating redundant vetting.
*   **Financialization of Agreements:** By tokenizing the lease (ERC-721), The Protocol enables the use of "Future Rent" receivables as collateral, unlocking liquidity for landlords.

### B. Why Web3 Architecture?
The selection of blockchain infrastructure is not merely aesthetic but functional:
1.  **Immutability:** Replaces "trust" with "verification." Payment history is indelible.
2.  **Real-Time Auditability:** Provides lenders and landlords with instant visibility into asset performance.
3.  **Capital Efficiency:** Removes banking intermediation, allowing the "Good Payer" behavior to directly monetize their reputation through yield generation.

## IV. BUSINESS MODEL & REVENUE ARCHITECTURE

The Protocol operates on a **Diversified Revenue Model** designed to capture value at every stage of the rental lifecycle.

| Revenue Stream | Fee Structure | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Processing Fee** | **1.00%** of Rent | Recurring monthly fee on all smart contract payments. (Primary Cash Flow) |
| **2. Yield Spread** | **Variable** (Spread) | Passive revenue from difference between Vault APY and User APY. |
| **3. Identity Mint** | **Fixed Fee** | One-time payment for minting the Tenant Passport & Soulbound Badges. |
| **4. Origination** | **1-2%** of Loan | Protocol fee for "Future Rent" liquidity loans (Senior/Junior Tranches). |

**Market Opportunity:** Targeting a Total Addressable Market (TAM) exceeding **$500M USD** in LATAM alone.
